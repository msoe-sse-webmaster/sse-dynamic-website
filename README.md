## Install and Dependencies

If you do not have NodeJS you can download it [here.](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

_Make sure that the npm package manager is also downloaded the NodeJS setup wizard._

After cloning the repo and downloading NodeJS run ```npm install``` on the command line in the directory that the project is stored in.

Once you have run the install command you can then run ```npm start``` to boot up a local version of the server. After this the cite should be available on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)
